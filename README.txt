The following README documents the changes made to class FreecellModel & Card.


FreecellModel
1) Changed all private fields and methods to protected so that the new FreecellModelMultiMove can have access to the fields and methods.

2) Move (case CASCADE) - changed a local variable movedCard so that it uses the inputted cardIndex from move() rather than the last card in the source pile.

3) Move (case CASCADE) - moved the condition that checks if the destinationPileNumber is less than the number of cascade piles to the beginning of the switch case.



Card
